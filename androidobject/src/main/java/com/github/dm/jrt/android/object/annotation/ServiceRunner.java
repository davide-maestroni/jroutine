/**
 * Through this annotation it is possible to set a specific runner class to be used by the Service
 * executing the routine invocations. The specified class must have a default constructor.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is used to decorate methods that are to be invoked in an asynchronous way.
 * <br>
 * Note that the piece of code inside such methods will be automatically protected so to avoid
 * concurrency issues. Though, other parts of the code inside the same class will be not.
 * <br>
 * In order to prevent unexpected behaviors, it is advisable to avoid using the same class fields
 * (unless immutable) in protected and non-protected code, or to call synchronous methods through
 * routines as well.
 * <p>
 * Finally, be aware that a method might need to be made accessible in order to be called. That
 * means that, in case a {@link java.lang.SecurityManager} is installed, a security exception might
 * be raised based on the specific policy implemented.
 * <p>
 * Remember also that, in order for the annotation to properly work at run time, the following rules
 * must be added to the project Proguard file (if employed for shrinking or obfuscation):
 * <pre>
 *     <code>
 *
 *         -keepattributes RuntimeVisibleAnnotations
 *         -keepclassmembers class ** {
 *              &#64;com.github.dm.jrt.android.object.annotation.ServiceRunner *;
 *         }
 *     </code>
 * </pre>
